In this repository, I'm putting some of the projects I've been doing using Python programming for data science learning. To ensure that the notebooks are displayed, I'm using nbviewer to avoid any potential problem in case the notebooks are not well displayed on Github.

- [Analyzing Used Car Listings](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Chaoukib/Python/blob/master/notebook_autos.ipynb)

- [Profitable App Profiles for the Apple Store and Google Play Markets](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Chaoukib/Python/blob/master/notebook_apps.ipynb)
